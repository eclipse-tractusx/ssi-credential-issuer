# Requirements overview

## What is the Portal & Marketplace Product?

The SSI Credential Issuer is a central API for the handling of credentials. It handles the wallet communication for the creation and revocation of credentials of the issuer and holder. Another purpose is the expiry handling and automatic revocation of already expired credentials. There is no plan to implement an UI at the current stage.
