# Create Credential Process

## Summary

The create credential process handles the creation of credentials. The process steps are the following:

    A(CREATE_SIGNED_CREDENTIAL) --> B(SAVE_CREDENTIAL_DOCUMENT)
    B --> C(CREATE_CREDENTIAL_FOR_HOLDER)
    C --> D(TRIGGER_CALLBACK)
```

## External dependencies

The process worker communicates with the Issuer Wallet to revoke the credential. It further more communicates with the portal backend to create notifications and mails.

## Process Steps

### CREATE_SIGNED_CREDENTIAL

The process step `CREATE_SIGNED_CREDENTIAL` is automatically triggered from the process worker. It calls the issuer wallet to create the requested credential.

### SAVE_CREDENTIAL_DOCUMENT

The process step `SAVE_CREDENTIAL_DOCUMENT` is automatically triggered from the process worker. Calls the issuer wallet to get the created credential to save it in the `documents` table.

### CREATE_CREDENTIAL_FOR_HOLDER

The process step `CREATE_CREDENTIAL_FOR_HOLDER` is automatically triggered from the process worker. If the wallet address is equal to the issuer wallet this step is skipped. Otherwise the created credential is imported to the holder wallet.

### TRIGGER_CALLBACK

The process step `TRIGGER_CALLBACK` is automatically triggered from the process worker. Posts a callback to the portal with a status of the credential creation.
