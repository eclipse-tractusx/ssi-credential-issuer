# Summary

The main process worker project is the `Processes.Worker` which runs all the processes. It therefor looks up `process_steps` in status `TODO` and their respective `processes` and executes those.

## Processes

The process worker supports the following processes:

- [CreateCredential](../processes/01.%20create_credential.md) - handles the creation of new credentials
- [DeleteCredential](../processes/02.%20delete_credential.md) - handles the revocation of credentials

## Retriggering

The process has a logic to retrigger failing steps. For this a retrigger step is created which can be triggered via an api call to retrigger the step. This logic is implemented separately for each process. In general the retriggering of a step is possible if for example external services are not available. The retrigger logic for each process can be found in the process file.
