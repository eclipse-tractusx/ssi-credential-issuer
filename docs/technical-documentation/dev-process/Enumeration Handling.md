# Enumeration

Enum or enumeration are used for data type consisting of named values like elements, status workflow, types, etc., that represent integral constants. Enums are non-transactional (so called static data) which can only get changed in a new application version. Changes in the operation mode of an application are not allowed since this will result into possible system breaks.

- process_types
- verified_credential_external_types
- verified_credential_type_kinds
- verified_credential_types

## Add Enums

New enums can get added easily be enhancing the enumeration table (via the seeding data). With the next deployment; the new enum is getting auto deployed to the respective env.
Since enums have an enhanced impact on the system functionality; it is mandatorily needed to test (FE wise) the impacted screens / flows before releasing new enums. It is likely that the enum has an enhanced impact on the user journey / flow and break the system if not well tested.

## Change Enums

Change of enums (labels) is possible but need to be done carefully and only if necessarily needed.
In the case a change is getting executed; the system configuration / appsettings / env. variables need to get checked to ensure that those don't refer to the enum which is getting changed/ updated.

## Delete Enums

Deletion of enums have following impacts

- Seeding data update needed (likely data need to get deleted / changed)
- Data inside the database in the different running environments need to get updated
- User flow process impacted
- Business logic impacted

**It is not recommended to delete enums.**
